# Route

Using Java, I developed my own implementation of a routing service that finds the best route between two cities in the United States. The program represents the US highway network as a graph and calculates routes and distances on this network. Therefore, theoretically, this program could be used to find the best route (series of edges) from a file containing a list of vertices. The program also contains a UI that allows the user to visualize the best route between the two cities on a map of the United States.

To test the project, run GraphDemo.java.

## Project Introduction

In this project you are asked to implement a routing service that represents the United States highway network as a graph and calculates routes and distances on this network. At a high level, in part 1 you will implement `GraphProcessor` which stores a graph representation and provides public methods to answer connectivity, distance, and pathfinding queries. This part of the project will be autograded as per usual. 

In part 2 you will implement a `main` method in `GraphProcessor` that produces a minimal viable product (also known as MVP) demonstrating the functionality of `GraphProcessor` and visualizing the results. For this part, you will record a brief demo of you or someone else *using* your program to find and visualize a route. [See this video](https://duke.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d3f2cc7a-902a-499f-850b-af4e014f8a07) for an example of a completed `GraphDemo` at work.

There is no analysis for this project.

The rest of this section introduces you to the starter code, especially the `Point` and `Visualize` classes, as well as the graph data we will be using.

### The `Point` Class

You are provided in the starter code with `Point.java` that represents an immutable (meaning it cannot be changed after creation) point on the Earth's surface. Each such point consists of a [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude), or north-south angle relative to the equator, and a [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude), or east-west angle relative to the prime meridian. We use the convention whereby **latitudes and longitudes are both measured in degrees between -180.0 and 180.0**, where positive latitudes are for north of the equator and negative latitudes are for south of the equator. Similarly, positive longitudes are for east of the prime meridian, and negative longitudes are for west of the equator. 

Vertices/nodes in the graph we will use to represent the United States highway system will be `Point` objects. You should not need to do edit anything in the `Point` class. However, you may wish to use the various methods that are supplied for you. These methods are described in more detail in the expandable section below.

<details><summary>Expand for details on Point methods</summary>

- `getLat` and `getLon` are getter methods for returning the values of the private latitude and longitude instance variables. 
- The `distance` method calculates the "straight-line" distance in US miles from one point to another. Note that latitudes and longitudes are *angles* and not x-y coordinates, so this calculation requires trigonometric projection onto a sphere. This can get a little complicated, see [great circle distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) if you're curious, but you do **not** need to understand or change this math. Please use the `distance` method provided and do not alter or implement a different one, for the sake of consistency with the autograder.
- The `equals` method checks if two points have the same `latitude` and `longitude`.
- The `hashCode` method has been implemented to be consistent with `equals`, and so that you can use `Point` objects in `HashSet`s or as keys in `HashMap`s.
- The `toString` allows you to directly print Point objects.
- The `compareTo` method compares `Point` objects by latitude, then breaks ties by longitude. Note that `Point implements Comparable<Point>`.

### The `Visualize` Class

One of the things you will be asked to do in your ultimate demo is create visualizations of the route(s) computed by your algorithms. To do this, you are provided with `Visualize.java` (which, in turn, uses `StdDraw.java`, though you won't need to directly call anything from this). You do not need to edit the `Visualize` class, though you will use it. The Visualize class is described in more detail in the expandable sectios below.

<details><summary>Expand for details on Visualize and methods</summary>

The constructor to create a `Visualize` object has two parameters. `visFile` should be a file in the `.vis` format:
```
min_longitude max_longitude
min_latitude max latitude
width height
```
where the ranges correspond to the left, right, bottom, and top boundaries respectively of the image onto which the graph will be visualized, and the width and height are the number of pixels in the image to be visualized. You are provided with 3 `.vis` files inside of the `data` folder, corresponding to the three images inside of the `images` folder.

`imageFile` should be a `.png` image with dimensions matching those supplied in the `visFile`. Three such images files are supplied inside of the `images` folder, each of which has a corresponding `.vis` file. These images were taken from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) for purely educational purposes and are not approved for commercial applications.

The `public` methods of `Visualize` are:
- `drawPoint` draws a single point on the image supplied.
- `drawEdge` draws an edge between two points on the `image` supplied.
- `drawGraph` takes a `List<Point>` and calls `drawPoint` on each, as well as a `List<Point[]>`, and attempts to call `drawEdge` on the index 0 and index 1 elements of each array in the latter list.
- `drawRoute` takes a `List<Point>` and draws each point in the list, connecting each subsequent two points by an edge. **This is the method you are most likely to directly use in visualizing the route(s) you calculate.**

### Graph Data

A graph consists of a number of vertices/nodes and the connections between them (known as edges). Our data represents highway networks, where vertices/nodes are points (see the [`Point` class](#the-point-class)) on the Earth's surface (think of them as intersections of highways) and the edges represent road segments. Our graph is **undirected**, meaning we assume every edge can be traversed in either direction. Our graph is also **weighted**, meaning the edges are not all of the same length. **The weight of an edge is the straight-line distance between its endpoints**, see [the `Point` class](#the-point-class) for the `distance` method.

The data we work with was originally pulled from the [METAL project by Dr. James D. Teresco](https://courses.teresco.org/metal/graph-formats.shtml). This data is intended for educational use only and not for any commercial purposes. It has been slightly modified and stored as `.graph` files inside of the `data` folder. Three `.graph` files are supplied, the first two are small and intended for development, testing, and debugging, and the third is much larger and intended for use in the final demo. All three have corresponding `.vis` and `.png` files for use with `Visualize`.

1. `simple.graph` contains a small abstract graph (meaning not a real road network) with ten nodes and ten edges. A visualization is shown below at the left. We recommend using `simple.graph` while developing/debugging your project, as it is much easier to reason about and you don't need to worry much about efficiency.

2. `durham.graph` contains a small but real-world graph, a subset of `usa.graph` that lies within the downtown Durham area. A visualization is shown below at the right. Note that now the graph is imposed on a real image of the road network of Durham instead of an abstract background. We recommend testing on `durham.graph` after you feel comfortable that your code is working on `simple.graph`.

  <img width="300" src="images/simpleGraph.png">
  <img width="300" src="images/durhamGraph.png">
</div>

3. `usa.graph` contains over 85 thousand vertices and edges representing the (continental) United States Highway Network. This is the network on which you will ultimately produce your demo, and for which the efficiency or not of your implementations may become noticeable.

The format of a `.graph` file is described in more detail in the expandable section below.

<details><summary>Expand for details on the `.graph` file format</summary>

Each `.graph` file represents a graph in the following format:

```
num_vertices num_edges
node0_name node0_latitude node0_longitude
node1_name node1_latitude node1_longitude
...
index_u_edge0 index_v_edge0 optional_edge0_name
index_v_edge1 index_v_edge1 optional_edge1_name
...
```
In other words:
- The first consists of the number of vertices and edges respectively, space separated.
- The next `num_vertices` lines describe one vertex/node per line, giving its name/label, then its latitude, then its longitude, all space separated.
- The next `num_edges` lines describe one edge per line, giving the index of its first endpoint and then the index of its second endpoint, space separated. These indices refer to the order in which the vertices/nodes appear in this file (0-indexed). For example, `0 1` would mean there is an edge between the first and second vertices listed above in the file. 
- There may or may not be an edge label/name after the indices for each edge; `simple.graph` and `durham.graph` do not include these labels, but `usa.graph` does, so you will need to be able to handle both cases.
